Some of the following graphs were randomly generated using generator tools from
the 1st DIMACS Challenge (ftp://dimacs.rutgers.edu/pub/netflow).


acyclic_100_nodes.totem
  A 100 node acyclic dense graph with no edge weights greater than 1000.
  Generated from the DIMACS Acyclic generator.

chain_100_nodes_weight_directed.totem
  A 100 node directed chain with each node having an arc toward the next
    successive node.

rmf_100_nodes.totem
  A 100 node randomly generated RMFGEN network developed by Goldfarb and
    Grigoriadis - "A computational comparison of the Dinic and Network Simplex
    methods for maximum flow". Annals of Operations Research 13 (1988),
    pp 83--123.
  Generated from the DIMACS GenRMF generator.

source_sink_maxflow.totem
  A trivial directed weighted graph.

washington_random.totem
  A rectangular grid of 100 nodes where each vertex in a row is connected to
    three randomly chosen vertices in the next row.
  Generated using the DIMACS Washington generator.
