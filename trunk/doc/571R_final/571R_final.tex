\begin{abstract}
The goal of this project is to understand the challenges in porting graph algorithms to commodity, hybrid platforms; platforms that consist of processors optimized for sequential processing and accelerators optimized for massively-parallel processing. The study starts from the observation that current graph processing platforms are either expensive (e.g., supercomputers) or inefficient (e.g., commodity clusters). Our hypothesis is that commodity hybrid platforms (e.g., GPU-supported clusters) can bridge the performance-cost gap, and offer an attractive graph-processing solution for many graph-based applications such as social networks and web analysis.

This work presents the first step towards designing {\sc Totem} -- a graph-processing framework that leverages massively parallel hybrid platforms. In particular, we give implementations of core graph algorithms (i.e., BFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, and PageR ank) and preliminary performance analysis of some of these algorithms. Also, we discuss the future work based on the current experience provided by these initial implementations.

\section{Progress to Date}
\label{sec:progress}

This section provides a description of the three algorithms implemented (\S~\ref{sec:implementation}) so far and some preliminary evaluation results (\S~\ref{sec:evaluation}). In summary, the work done so far consists of literature review, which is described in the related work section (\S~\ref{sec:related}) and an initial implementation that will serve as the basis for the framework.
