\section{Problem}
\label{sec:problem}

Given a set of processors $\mathcal{P}$ and a workload $\mathcal{W}$, the {\em graph workload partitioning} problem of maximizing Equation~\ref{eq:throughput_sys} is equivalent to the following problem:

\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
   \underset{i}{\text{maximize }}
    & t_i(\mathcal{W}_i) \\
    \text{subject to}
    & & |\mathcal{W}_i| \leq |p_i|, \; i = 1, \ldots, c.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

where $|\mathcal{W}_i|$ denotes the memory footprint of a graph workload partition $\mathcal{W}_i$, and $|p_i|$ indicates the memory capacity of processor $p_i$. 

Assuming that the time a processor takes to process a given edge is constant, if the edge's vertices are located in the processor's local memory, the problem can be written as a minimization of the number of edges in each partition that have remote vertices. More formally,   

\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    \text{minimize }
    & \sum_i^c|E_i^r| \\
    \text{subject to}
    & & |\mathcal{W}_i| \leq |p_i|, \; i = 1, \ldots, c.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

By making some assumptions about $T_i(e)$ (i.e., the time $p_i$ takes to process an edge), we could translate this problem further into a {\em modularity maximization} problem and start with informed graph partioning algorithms based on Newman's approach~\cite{Newman2006} and .

        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Check/improve notation; 
          \item Prove that this problem is NP-hard by showing it is exactly as a graph partioning problem with constraints;
          \item List and discuss promising heuristics; 
          \item Extend the model to compute the partitioning algorithm cost in the total application execution -- the idea is to fold this into the workload $\mathcal{W}^{*} = (\mathcal{A}^{*}, G)$ submitted to $p_0$, where $\mathcal{A}^{*}$ is a particular graph partitioning algorithm;
          \item Characterize Equation~\ref{eq:throughput_p} with some experiments on a CPU/GPU environment.
        \end{enumerate}}
