/**
 * Defines the graph interface. Mainly the data-structure, and its initialize
 * and finalize methods.
 *
 * The following is the totem graph file format template:
 *
 * # NODES: vertex_count [Y]
 * # EDGES: edge_count
 * # DIRECTED|UNDIRECTED
 * [VERTEX LIST]
 * [EDGE LIST]
 *
 * The first three lines specify the vertex and edge counts, whether the
 * graph is directed or not and whether the graph has a vertex list.
 * Note that the flag [Y] after vertex_count indicates that a vertex list
 * should be expected.
 *
 * The vertices are assumed to have numerical IDs that ranges from 0 to
 * vertex_count. The vertices are sorted in an increasing order.
 *
 * A vertex list is an optional list that defines a value for each vertex.
 * Each line in the vertex list defines the value associated with a vertex
 * as follows: "VERTEX_ID VALUE". The parser expects the vertex ids to be sorted
 * in the vertex list. Although a value is not needed for each vertex, a value
 * for the last vertex (i.e., vertex id = vertex_count - 1) is required as it is
 * used as an end-of-list signal. If a value does not exist for a vertex, it
 * will be assigned a default one.
 *
 * An edge list represents the edges in the graph. Each line describes a single
 * edge, optionally with a weight as follows: "SOURCE DESTINATION [WEIGHT]". If
 * the weight does not exist, it will be assigned a default value.

// TODO(elizeu): We should define a #-directive to allow multiple definitions
//               of the following two types and related constants. The goal is

//               applications will use.
/**
 * Specifies an id type. 
 * We have two id types (vid_t and eid_t). The rule to use them is as follows: 
 * anything that is constrained by the number of vertices should be defined 
 * using the vid_t type, similarly anything that is constrained by the number
 * of edges eid_t should be used as a type. For example, to access the vertices
 * array, a vid_t index is used, while accessing the edges array requires an 
 * index of type eid_t. A typical iteration over the graph looks like this:
 * 
 * for (vid_t vid = 0; vid < graph->vertex_count; vid++) {
 *   for (eid_t eid = graph->vertices[vid]; 
 *        eid < graph->vertices[vid + 1]; eid++) {
 *     vid_t nbr_id = graph->edges[eid];
 *     // do stuff to the neighbour
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * Finally, to enable 64 bit edge ids, the code must be compiled: make EID=64
