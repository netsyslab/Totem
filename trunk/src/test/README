The assumptions is that unit tests have the following naming format:
totem_[test_name]_unittest.cc 
Based on this, running make only will generate a single all.test binary that
compile and link all tests together.

If you want to compile a single test:
make TEST=test_name.

No need to modify the makefile to add new tests, just follow the file naming
convention.
